To run the `runK6Test` method, import and call it in your script:

Example: Create new `testFile.ts`file and copy paste the below example code ,

replace your `reportPath`, `AiUrl` and `apikey` with correct values .

```javascript
import { runK6Test } from 'nilgiriperformance';

const testConfig = {
  url: "https://example.com",
  options: {
    vus: 10,
    duration: "30s"
  },
  aireport: {
    reportPath: "./performance_report.html",
    AiUrl: "https://ai-analysis-api.com",
    apikey: "your-api-key"
  },
  detailedReportjson: "./performance_metrics.json"
};

runK6Test(testConfig)
  .then(() => console.log('Performance test completed successfully!'))
  .catch(err => console.error('Error:', err));
```

<h1 align="center"> üìä AI-Enhanced Performance Reports</h1>

## Report Preview
![Performance Report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bhuvaneshp2998/Performance-nilgiri/main/logo/PerformanceReport.png)

---


The **K6 Performance Test Report** provides a comprehensive analysis of your application's performance based on simulated user traffic. The report is designed to help developers, testers, and stakeholders understand key performance metrics in a visually intuitive format.

## üü¢ Summary Metrics

The report displays high-level performance indicators in **colored tiles** at the top, offering a quick glance at critical statistics:

| Metric            | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Total Requests** | Total number of HTTP requests executed during the test. |
| **Time Duration** | The total execution time of the test. |
| **Virtual Users** | Number of concurrent users simulated during the test. |
| **Throughput** | The rate at which requests were processed per second. |
| **Pass Count** | Number of successful requests (HTTP 200 status). |
| **Fail Count** | Number of failed requests due to errors or timeouts. |
| **Iterations** | Number of times the test script was executed. |
| **Error Rate** | Percentage of failed requests compared to total requests. |

## üìà Performance Graphs

Below the summary tiles, the report provides two visual representations of **performance trends** using bar and line charts.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ HTTP Request Duration (Bar Chart)
This chart displays the **distribution of HTTP response times** across different statistical metrics:

- **Min, Median, Average** ‚Äì Represent baseline response times.
- **Max** ‚Äì The slowest request recorded during the test.
- **p90, p95** ‚Äì The **90th and 95th percentile** values, indicating the response time thresholds below which 90% or 95% of requests completed.

#### üìå Interpretation:
A high **max response time** or **p95 value** suggests potential performance bottlenecks. Optimizing server response times, caching strategies, or load balancing might be necessary.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Iteration Duration (Line Chart)
This chart represents the **time taken for each test iteration** over different statistical points:

- **Min, Median, Average** ‚Äì General test execution time trends.
- **Max, p90, p95** ‚Äì Indicators of performance spikes.

#### üìå Interpretation:
A **steadily increasing trend** may indicate performance degradation over time, possibly due to memory leaks, inefficient resource management, or increasing server load.

## üìå Additional Insights

üîπ **Performance Metrics Dropdown**  
Expands to provide a more detailed breakdown of test execution times and resource utilization.

üîπ **AI Analysis Dropdown**  
Since this report AI-powered analysis is enabled, this section offers **automated insights and recommendations** to optimize performance based on test results.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Report?

- Identify potential bottlenecks by analyzing **high response times** and **failure rates**.
- Compare **p90/p95 percentiles** against expected SLAs (Service Level Agreements).
- Use AI-generated insights (if enabled) to apply recommended optimizations.
- Adjust test configurations (e.g., increasing virtual users) to simulate real-world scenarios accurately.
